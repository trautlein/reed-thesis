  \section{Congressional Leaders}\label{congressional-leaders}
  
  Party leaders are hugely important in Congress. Perhaps their most
  important role is setting the legislative agenda in Congress (Rohde
  1991, @Sinclair1983). By setting the agenda in arguably the most
  powerful branch of government, congressional leaders have extraordinary
  power over which bills are brought to a vote and eventually passed. They
  also have the power of being able to shift congressional actions away
  from an otherwise sipmles answer to a problem.\footnote{For a recent
    example of this, see how in 2008 Harry Reid (D) then the majority
    leader of the Senate, was able to remove the possibility of a nuclear
    waste repository from being created at Yucca Mountain.} Leaders in
  Congress have large sway over the leaders who they can choose to fill
  the many roles below them. They are also the ``brand image'' of their
  party, especially when their party does not control the presidency.
  Understanding the ideology of leaders is important for a Congressional
  scholar to better understand why leaders act the way the do.
  
  There has often been the question of whether or not congressional
  leaders are moderates in their party, near to their party's mean, or
  extremists. Moderates would often be effective legislators, as they
  would be able to propose more centrist policies that might apply to both
  political parties. Extremists might be selected due to their ability to
  placate the louder wings of both the Republican and Democratic parties.
  A political scientist or an economist might be quick to answer that a
  congressperson near the median voter in a political party has a strong
  theoretical reasoning for being chosen. This is because votes for
  congressional leaders are votes taken solely within the party.\footnote{With
    the exception of the vote for Speaker in the House of Representatives,
    although that vote often ends up being made up entirely of the
    majority party's congresspersons voting in affirmation with the
    minority party avoiding casting a positive ballot.} The median voter
  theorem states that ``a majority rule voting system will select the
  outcome most preferred by the median voter'' (Holcombe 2006, 115). This
  builds off the assumption that there is only one dimension along which
  politics exists, for example, left to right or liberal to conservative.
  Is it also assumed that a voter will choose the option, or in this
  circumstance the politician, closest to their own ideal point along the
  singular dimension. In a majoritarian system this ideal median point
  will prevail, having more than 50\% of the vote in the final vote
  tallied.
  
  Studies have examined where leaders come from ideologically speaking.
  One has found, using the DW-NOMINATE scores of congressional leaders,
  that these leaders do in fact come from near the median of their party,
  with a tiny preference towards the slightly more extreme candidate,
  left-leaning for Democrats and right-leaning for Republicans.
  DW-NOMINATE scores place congresspersons on a single dimension from -1
  to 1, with -1 being left-leaning and 1 being right-leaning. The numbers
  are found by taking the roll call votes over a single Congress and then
  placing the legislator's scores within the range of possible values. A
  senator like Ted Cruz would end up with a number close to 1\footnote{In
    the 113th Congress his point was measured at 0.754.} whereas for
  senator like Elizabeth Warren you would see a point near to -1\footnote{In
    the 113th Congress her point was measured at -0.538}. House Democrats
  were found to be on average -0.050 away from the median point whereas
  their leaders were on overage -0.097, slightly farther away but still
  close to the median. For Senate Democrats these numbers are 0.016 and
  -0.059 respectively, again the the leaders being slighly more extreme
  than the median but still being quite close to it. For the Republicans
  the results are similar, although in the other direction. In the House,
  for leaders the average distance away from the party median for leaders
  is 0.044 whereas for the rest of the House Republicans it is -0.025. For
  the Senate Republicans the numbers are 0.048 and 0.057,
  respectively.\footnote{The Republicans in the Senate are the only group
    who elect leaders slightly more moderate on average than the party
    median in that chamber.} They find it ``hearening to note that
  leaders--who some political observers argue have strong influence over
  angenda setting and lawmaking under certain conditions--are, on balance,
  fairly representative of their parties. If leaders came from the far
  extremes of the chambers\ldots{}then policy might be even less
  reflective of the preferences of the median voter in the electorate''
  (Jessee and Malhotra 2010, see specifically 386). Jessee and Malhotra
  (2010) also find that the winner of a congressional leadership race is
  not ``ideologically distinctive'' from the entire pool candidates (2010,
  361).
  
  This evidence found in Jessee and Malhotra (2010) looked to revise
  earlier studies on the subject. Harris and Nelson (2008) looked at the
  old ``Austin-Boston'' alliance that encourage the selection of middlemen
  in the Democratic party, and also examine the changes within the
  Republican party leadership as well. Surprised by the election of the
  relatively extreme Pelosi to the Speakership, the two authors felt the
  need to revisit the question of whether the median voter theorem still
  held.\footnote{While the middle\emph{men} theory could still hold, the
    middle\emph{person} theory was in doubt.} Using the same dataset as
  Jessee and Malhotra (2010), they came to a new conclusion, that perhaps
  more partisan leaders were need as political polarization increased.
  Seeing the role switch from a place for compromise during a ``bargaining
  era and bipartisan Congress'' to a new bully pulpit, often active in the
  media and courting donors, middlepersons seemed to no longer be the most
  appropriate leaders of their party on the national stage of Congress
  (Harris and Nelson 2008, 54). Their final hypothesis is that as partisan
  divisions increase it will exacerbate the extremism of congressional
  leaders.
  
  Older research is more theoretical and is less likely to use datasets,
  like the many NOMINATE datasets available. In May (1973) leaders are
  suggested to be more extreme than the rest of their party when ideology
  is strongly important, which may connect well to the modern era. Studies
  of both British and Norwegian legislative systems cast doubt on May's
  concept, the law of curvilinear disparity.\footnote{,,todo - Unlikely
    that I should go into more depth, but maybe I could within a footnote?}
  The middleman theory is further promoted by Clausen and Wilcox (1987),
  who finds the best support for the theory in the House and then best
  within the Democratic party, which had at the time been the majority
  power for 32 years. Quickly stated, they claim that ``leaders are chosen
  who are\ldots{}dedicated to represent and prosecute the party position''
  (Clausen and Wilcox 1987, 261). More studies find evidence that leaders
  are more extreme than the median voter theorem would suggest, as
  Grofman, Koetzle, and McGann find that Democratic leaders are to the
  left of the median of their party and Republican leaders are to the
  right of the median of their party (Grofman, Koetzle, and McGann
  (2002)).
  
  \section{DW-NOMINATE}\label{dw-nominate}
  
  Keith Poole's and Howard Rosenthal's previous work about congressional
  ideology is the backbone of this study. they have constructed a way to
  fit members of Congress across a unidimensional metric that measures
  primarily ideology. Their typical dataset measures a single ``ideal
  point'' for each congressperson throughout their career and is able to
  plot them against other members of Congress throughout its existence.
  There are alternative versions of their dataset that also exist, and I
  use the Nokken and Poole version, which allows members to shift their
  ideology throughout different sessions of Congress (Nokken and Poole
  2004). There is often a clamoring by many for the structure of Congress
  to be displayed in multiple different dimesions, sometimes even one
  dimension for every issue available. More often however there is a
  request for a second dimension that allows not just a conservative
  versus liberal axis but instead a socially liberal versus socially
  conservative axis and a fiscally liberal versus fiscally conservative
  axis. While at times a second axis is useful, and in the most recent
  session of Congress can be viewed as a measure of establishment versus
  non-establishment leanings, Poole and Rosenthal as well as those who
  have use their datasets in the past primarily look to create their
  models solely from this one dimension due to its explanatory power
  (Poole and Rosenthal 2007, 21). Part of the reason why complicated
  legislators are able to represented along a single metric is due to the
  prevalence of logrolling or vote trading (Poole and Rosenthal 2007, 17).
  The primary dimension is not solely concerned with political party
  however, it also strongly relates to issues of economic redistribution
  (Poole and Rosenthal 2007, 70).
  
  Looking ahead to how the legislators, specifically the leaders, might
  change within my own study is evidence that ``essentially all movement
  is captured by simple linear movement'' along the single explanatory
  dimension, which suggests that more complicated ideological flip flops
  are rare within Congress (Poole and Rosenthal 2007, 29).\footnote{,,todo-would
    love to include more on this at some point}
  
  Poole and Rosenthal are able to look at the patterns of how ideology has
  changed in the history of Congress. I will solely be looking at post-WW2
  data as that is when congressional leadership started becoming truly
  strong in both the House and Senate.\footnote{Before that it was
    sometimes non-existant, especially in the smaller Senate, where
    leadership was not needed as much to organize the many members of each
    party.} They note that ``{[}t{]}he period from the late New Deal until
  the mid-1970s saw the development of the only genuine
  three-political-party system in American history. The southern and
  northern Democrats may have joined together to organize the House and
  Senate but they were widely separated on the second dimension. This
  dimension picked up conflict over civil rights'' (Poole and Rosenthal
  2007, 54). During this time there was a conservative coalition between
  the southern Democrats and most Republicans that was in conflict with
  the northern Democrats as well a a few northern Republicans (Poole and
  Rosenthal 2007, 54--56). It is unfortunate that this sole time of a
  three-political-party sytem exists during the data that I plan to use,
  but this may make my results stronger in less turbulant times. By the
  ``mid-to-late 1970s the party-line voting returned to a more
  {[}unidimensional{]} pattern'' (Poole and Rosenthal 2007, 57). This was
  due to the passage of civil rights legislation that either revolved
  conflicts within the parties or caused legislators to switch from one
  party to another Throughout the rest of congressional history the single
  dimension remains but what the dimensions refers to evolves slowly.
  Within each individual Congress it is easy to see the majority of
  conflicts along a single dimension (MacDonald and Rabinowitz 1987).
  
  Something that should help my analysis is the movement towards a more
  ``unidimesional politics'' in the most recent sessions of Congress. The
  ideological overlap along this single dimension between the parties is
  essentially gone. The last Congress in which there was an overlap in the
  Senate was the 109th, which ended in early 2007. The second dimension
  has lost much of it's explanatory power towards party since the 104th
  Congress, which began in 1995. Poole and Rosenthal say that ``the modern
  Congress is turly unidimensional'' in 2005, which was before the even
  greater polarization that began then and continues to move the two
  parties father apart (Poole and Rosenthal 2007, 55). The first
  dimension, while often refered to as ``ideology,'' can be though of in a
  few different ways. It could be that the dimension is ``thought of as
  ranging from strong loyalty to one party'' to a strong dislike of the
  policies of another party; this can often explain the placement of many
  independent or otherwise third-party congressmen\footnote{As every
    third-party Representative or Senator has been a man.} existing
  seemingly deep within another party (Poole and Rosenthal 2007, 55).
  
  Poole and Rosenthal put dimensionality and roll call voting agendas well
  in the following quote: ``In a nutshell, the roll cal voting agenda of
  Congress is always a cornucopia of diverse issues, even if many issues
  are screened from the agenda. This diversity notwithstanding, to the
  extent that spatial models are useful in describing the roll call voting
  data, only low-dimensional models are needed'' (2007, 69).

  \chapter{Methodology}\label{methodology}
  
  I will use the \texttt{acf} function available in \textbf{R} to best
  estimate the number of years I should lag my data. It is assumed that I
  will see the highest correlation and covariance at the with a lag of
  \texttt{1}, meaning one congresional session behind.The correlation and
  covariance will be expected to slowly drop off. Once this \texttt{acf}
  function has been properly plotted I will be able to then move towards
  the fitting of a model to my data. To do that I will first seperate the
  data into two groups, Republicans and Democrats. Then again that data
  will be seperated into two groups, leaders and non-leaders. I will find
  the mean change of each party's ideology by congressional session within
  the \texttt{D-NOMINATE} dataset. Then I will compare the changes through
  each Congress of non-leaders to leaders within each party. This will
  allow me to see the differences in ideological change of one group
  versus the others.
  
  \chapter{Results and Discussion}\label{results-and-discussion}
  
  \section{Results}\label{results}
  
  \subsection{Results for Complete
  Dataset}\label{results-for-complete-dataset}
  
  Some statistically significant results are found in my most basic
  regression. These are the linear regressions computed across all the
  available congressional sessions that have complete leader data in both
  the House and the Senate, from the 67th Congress (1921-1923) to the
  recent 113th Congress (2013-2015).

  \end{tabular}
  \end{table}
  
  All of the control variables that were enlisted were found to be
  statistically signicant. These three variables were the idelogical mean
  of congress, the ideological mean of congress from the previous
  congressional session, and the congressperson's ideology from the
  previous congressional session. For all three of these variables across
  both parties in both the House and Senate the p-value was always less
  than 0.0001. It is clear that a legislator's current ideology would be
  affected by what their ideology was in the previous congressional
  session. While not as obvious, it also makes sense that you would need
  to understand the greater political environment that their party is in
  within their chamber. For example, if congresspeople as a whole were
  becoming more polarized at a rapid rate, as they are currently, you
  would expect a singular congressperson to be rapidly polarizing as well.
  Knowing how the party has changed from the previous Congress to the most
  recent one allows you to help control for this effect.
  
  \subsubsection{Democrats}\label{democrats}
  
  Across all of the years the leadership variable was statistically
  significant for the Senate Democrats and the House Democrats,
  represented by the bold text in Table 3.1 above. The Senate Democrats
  noticed a small shift, approximately a 0.02 leftward shift on the
  D-NOMINATE scale, indicating that leaders become slightly more liberal
  across Congresses than their non-leader counterparts. The result was not
  significant at a confidence level of the normal 0.05, but with a p-value
  of 0.059 it would be recognized as significant at a slighty higher
  confidence level. For reasons laid out farther below, I do not think
  that this is reason enough to disregard this result, as I would guess
  that this is an underestimate rather than an overestimate. The overall
  shift is small, only a 0.02 movement towards the more liberal side, but
  not insignificant.
  
  A statistically significant shift was also noticed among the House
  Democrats. They had an even more statistically significant result, with
  a p-value of about 0.015, a much stronger result than that found above
  with the Senate Democrats. It is strong enough that with the somewhat
  arbritrary confidence level of 0.05 the predictor remains signficant.
  The coefficient attached is also larger, 0.03, again with a leftwards
  shift farther towards the Democratic party extreme, farther towards
  congresspeople like Senator Sanders and Senator Brown and away from
  conservatives like Senator Collins and Senator Risch. Again, the overall
  shift is small but not worth disregarding, however if one was looking to
  predict the ideological score of a House Democrat you would not pick
  leadership status as one of your first predictors.
  
  \subsubsection{Republicans}\label{republicans}
  
  It is important to talk about the null results received for Republicans
  in both the House and Senate. While neither of the results were
  significant, the regression for the Senate did hint at a possible
  ideological change due to leadership, with a coefficient of 0.013
  towards the more conservative side. Accompanied by a p-value of 0.19
  they must be looked at skeptically, and instead perhaps taken as a hint
  for future study as opposed to a specific result. The coefficient found
  here is similar to the results found for the Democrats, they they moved
  more towards their party's extreme edges when they were leaders. It was
  not as strong as the coefficient found for either the House Democrats or
  the Senate Democrats, but it is no as weak as the Republican House,
  covered below. While significant was not found in this elementary
  regression, perhaps a regression with better controls and a stronger
  method might be able to find results that are not just statistically
  significant but also are statistically sound.
  
  The House Republicans however seem to be very far away from any possible
  impact of leadership on ideology. They had a p-value of 0.65, far away
  from any reasonable confidence level. Even if it had been significant
  the coefficient attached was incredibly small, 0.004, towards the more
  moderate wing fo the Republican party or the Democratic party itself.
  These results are not in sync with the results found for the other three
  groups analyzed here, and I might suggest that looking at
  
  \subsubsection{Comments on Null Results}\label{comments-on-null-results}
  
  With the model I have created I think it is likely that the significance
  of leadership on ideology is underestimated. The change in leadership
  could have an effect on how the ideology of an entire caucus moves.
  Speaker Ryan right now is trying hard to make his ideology the ideology
  of the entire party, as he has pushed his agenda of ``Confident
  America'' (Steinhauer 2016). Ryan is closer to the mean ideological
  scores of the Freedom Caucus, and one would imagine that a concerted
  effort to continue to elect leaders of more extreme ideologies might
  allow the rest of the party to move along with them towards their more
  extreme wings (Enten 2015).
  
  Also the model might underestimate the importance of being a leader for
  a few another reasons. For example, leaders are a part of the data on
  the last congressional ideological mean and the current congressional
  ideological mean. Also leaders might have altered their early,
  pre-leader ideology because they expected or wanted to become leaders in
  the future. All of these could account for the differences among the
  significance of the leadership variable among the Democrats when
  compared to the Republicans. Perhaps Republicans were more likely to
  know they wanted to pursue leadership since they first entered office,
  or maybe they were more likely to shift along with their leaders,
  causing the entire mean of the party to move, possibly nullifing the
  effects of a leader's move.
  
  \subsection{Results for Subsets of
  Dataset}\label{results-for-subsets-of-dataset}
  
  I took subsets of the data by Congressional periods to try to see if
  leaders were ever more important across certain time periods then they
  were over the entire dataset. There are many different ways to break up
  Congress, one way suggested by (Stewart 2012, 96--97) is the breaking
  into six different systems, of which only three are during the time
  period that was able to be coded wih leaders. They are:
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    \textbf{Industrial System}: 1921-1932: Actually 1894-1932, but for the
    purposes of our coding only a smaller amount of it can be analyzed. A
    party of industry and a party of labor, with northern and southern
    regionalism factoring into parties heavily. Republicans were primarily
    northern and industrial, whereas Democrats were primarily southern and
    labor focused.
  \item
    \textbf{New Deal System}: 1932-1972: Democrats become more liberal as
    the Republicans become more conservative compared to industrial
    system, but the regionalism does not completely fade away.

    \textbf{Candidate-centered system}: 1972-present: After the tension
    that existed in the United States in the sixties, the regional
    importance shifts away as ideology begins to matter more and
    polarization of the parties continues (Stewart 2012, 96).
  \end{itemize}
  
  This system of breaking up the parties is not the only manner in which
  one could break them up, and subscribes to the views that are not taken
  as true across all of the political science literature. Some push both
  the Industrial and New Deal system together as one Congressional period.
  Yet the years themselves above seem to delineate good beginning breaking
  points for me to subset the data.
  
  Subsets were not useful to explain how House Democrats voted. During all
  of the systems the p-value were relatively high. That being said the
  subsetting did reduce the p-value by a significant amount, bringing the
  p-value for all three eras to between 0.22 and 0.26. This is an
  improvement when compared to the original 0.65 value received, but not
  enought to pass a positive judgement on the effects of these values. The
  coefficients were also stronger than they were when all of the eras were
  lumped together, but they still are smaller than the absolute value of
  the coefficients that exist for the Democrats in the House and Senate.
  
  The values obtained for the Senate Republicans did not all become more
  explanatory as they did for the House Republicans. The p-value increases
  for all eras except for the New Deal era, when it moves down to 0.14.
  But during the Industrial and Candidate-centered systems the p-values
  increase dramatically to point where they seem unable to be rationalized
  in any way.

  There are five different outcomes that are possible with the above
  methodology.
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    A null result is found - the leaders and non-leaders do not change in
    significantly different ways.
  \item
    Leaders move to be more conservative, or right-leaning, when compared
    to non-leaders.
  \item
    Leaders move to be more liberal, or left-leaning, when compared to
    non-leaders.
  \item
    Leaders move to be more moderate, or centrist, when compared to
    non-leaders.
  \item
    Leaders move to be more extreme when compared to non-leaders.
  \end{enumerate}
  
  There are compelling reasons for many of these to be true. For outcome
  where the null result is found this could make sense if leaders and
  non-leaders have little reason to be different. One could imagine
  leaders becoming more conservative compared to non-leaders due to age of
  many of the leaders within Congress and the relation between ideology
  and age. They could become more moderate in order to fascilitate the
  dealmaking that must be done in Congress in order to get legislation
  passed. Or perhaps they would becoem more extreme in order to placate
  their more extreme bases, only choosing to delineate from them in the
  rarest of circumstances.

  This study was particularly important because while a reasonable amount
  of information exists about how leaders are chosen to their positions
  based on their ideology it was not completely clear about how their
  ideology might shift after they have been selected by their fellow
  members of Congress. This thesis has looked to narrow our gap of
  understanding of these topics. However, more research is need in the
  long run especially research that involves stronger statistical methods
  that can better compensate for the sometimes small number of
  observations that exist on the models that make reference to the
  leaders. Research could also be done on whether these leaders are
  encouraging partisanship in Congress due to their ideology or halting
  it, as one of the key pieces of information found within this dataset is
  the great partisanship and polarization of the two dominating parties
  within American politics.
