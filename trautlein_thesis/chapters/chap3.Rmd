#Results

There are five different outcomes that are possible with the above methodology.

  1. A null result is found - the leaders and non-leaders do not change in significantly different ways.
  2. Leaders move to be more conservative, or right-leaning, when compared to non-leaders.
  3. Leaders move to be more liberal, or left-leaning, when compared to non-leaders.
  4. Leaders move to be more moderate, or centrist, when compared to non-leaders.
  5. Leaders move to be more extreme when compared to non-leaders.
  
There are compelling reasons for many of these to be true. For outcome where the null result is found this could make sense if leaders and non-leaders have little reason to be different. One could imagine leaders becoming more conservative compared to non-leaders due to age of many of the leaders within Congress and the relation between ideology and age. They could become more moderate in order to fascilitate the dealmaking that must be done in Congress in order to get legislation passed. Or perhaps they would becoem more extreme in order to placate their more extreme bases, only choosing to delineate from them in the rarest of circumstances.
