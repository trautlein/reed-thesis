This paper examines the differences in ideological change in Congress between those in party leadership and those outside of it. Using the Nokken-Poole version of DW-NOMINATE an analysis examines the importance of leadership on ideological change. No significant difference is found in many groups. However, especially among Democrats and also during the New Deal political system there is a higher significance of the effect of leadership on a legislator's ideology. The significant effects are all towards the more liberal end of the ideological spectrum. Theories regarding party stability and a party's margin in a chamber are used to better understand how and why these legislators may change. The paper concludes with a call for greater research into the subject, in particular with some case studies on leadership in order to better understand the effects occurring a smaller level and also to eventually bring more complicated statistical methods to better solve this problem.
