# Discussion


As discusssed above, there were five different possible hypotheses that we were able to come up with - one null hypothesis and four alternative hypotheses. Again, I will repeat all five of them below.

  1. A null result is found - the leaders and non-leaders do not change in significantly different ways.
  2. Leaders move to be more conservative, or right-leaning, when compared to non-leaders.
  3. Leaders move to be more liberal, or left-leaning, when compared to non-leaders.
  4. Leaders move to be more moderate, or centrist, when compared to non-leaders.
  5. Leaders move to be more extreme when compared to non-leaders.
  
Luckily I need not pick only one hypothesis above to describe the phenomena observed because three of the hypotheses seemed to be correct, depending on the circumstance.

Firstly, the null hypothesis seems to be correct in the vast majority of situations. While the 


Secondly, the Democrats seemed to be explained well by the third hypothesis above, that leaders become more liberal when compared to non-leaders. There are a number of reasons why this could take place. Perhaps one of the most largest reasons I see being the case is that one of the largest threats for these leaders is that they are receiving a large amount of media attention and may attract a primary opponent.

Thirdly, the fifth hypothesis also can follow from the third hypothesis above because there are only results on the Democratic side.
